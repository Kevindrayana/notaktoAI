## a notakto (3-board tic-tac-toe) bot which has a 100% win-rate

Notakto is a tic-tac-toe variant. It is played across three 3 x 3 boards: Board A, board B and board C. 
Each player takes turns placing an X on the board(s) in a vacant space (a space not occupied by an X already on the board). 
If a board has a three-in-a-row, the board is dead and it cannot be played on any more. 
When one player makes a three-in-a-row and there are no more boards to play on, that player loses.
